This project focuses on financial analysis using Twitter (X) finance-related news to identify trends, sentiment, and their potential impact on the stock market. Using Python and NLP techniques, tweets are collected, cleaned, and analyzed for sentiment to understand market mood and investor behavior. Libraries like Tweepy, TextBlob, and scikit-learn are used for data collection and sentiment classification. The analysis helps uncover correlations between public sentiment and financial market movements, making it useful for traders, analysts, and researchers.
